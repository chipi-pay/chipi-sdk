## Getting Started

**Chipi SDK: The Fastest Way to Ship on StarkNet Mainnet**

Chipi SDK combines invisible wallet creation with social login and Avnu’s paymaster to streamline dApp development on StarkNet. Users log in with familiar accounts (Google, X, Meta), and a wallet is generated behind the scenes—no manual key management needed. Focus on building features instead of dealing with blockchain complexities.
