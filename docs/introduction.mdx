## Getting Started

**Chipi SDK: The Fastest Way to Ship on StarkNet Mainnet**

Chipi SDK combines invisible wallet creation with social login and Avnu's paymaster to streamline dApp development on StarkNet. Users log in with familiar accounts (Google, X, Meta), and a wallet is generated behind the scenes—no manual key management needed. Focus on building features instead of dealing with blockchain complexities.

## Available Actions

The Chipi SDK provides several powerful actions to help you build blockchain applications without the complexity:

- **Create Wallet** - Generate invisible wallets for your users seamlessly 
- **Approve** - Authorize tokens for contract interactions
- **Stake** - Enable users to stake their assets
- **Withdraw** - Facilitate withdrawals from smart contracts
- **Transfer** - Send tokens between addresses
- **Call Any Contract** - Interact with any smart contract on StarkNet

## Use Cases

Chipi SDK enables frictionless blockchain experiences across various domains:

### AI Agents
Create AI assistants that can interact with blockchain on behalf of users. Enable AI agents to perform token swaps, manage assets, or execute transactions without requiring users to understand wallet management.

### DeFi Applications
Build investment platforms, lending solutions, or trading interfaces where users can participate in DeFi without the complexity of managing private keys or handling gas fees.

### Gaming
Integrate NFTs, in-game economies, and achievements on StarkNet with social logins that gamers are already familiar with. Enable seamless asset trading and ownership without disrupting gameplay.

### E-commerce
Allow customers to make blockchain-based purchases using familiar login methods. Implement loyalty programs, digital ownership verification, or exclusive products backed by blockchain technology.

### Social Platforms
Create decentralized social networks where users' digital identities and content ownership are secured by StarkNet without users needing technical blockchain knowledge.
