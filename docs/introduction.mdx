## Getting Started

**Chipi SDK: The Fastest Way to Ship on StarkNet Mainnet**

Our SDK solves a major pain point in the StarkNet ecosystem: the lack of mature, ready-to-use tools for wallet integration. By offering invisible wallet creation through social login, we eliminate the need for users to manually manage keys. This approach drastically reduces development time compared to ecosystems like Solana or Ethereum, where such tools already exist.

Automate invisible wallet creation on StarkNet with social login and Avnu’s paymaster—speeding up your dApp development cycle.”
