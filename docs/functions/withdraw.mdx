# withdraw(params)

Withdraws tokens from a staking contract. Internally uses `executeTransaction` to call the `withdraw` entrypoint.

## Parameters

- **pin** (string): The same PIN used to encrypt the wallet.
- **wallet** (WalletData): An object containing the wallet's `publicKey` and `encryptedPrivateKey`.
- **contractAddress** (string): The address of the staking contract.
- **amount** (string | number): The number of tokens to withdraw.
- **decimals** (number, optional): How many decimals the token uses. Defaults to 18.
- **recipient** (string): The address that will receive the withdrawn tokens.

## Usage

```ts
import { ChipiSDK } from '@chipi-pay/chipi-sdk';

const sdk = new ChipiSDK({
  apiKey: 'your-paymaster-api-key',
  rpcUrl: 'https://starknet-goerli.infura.io/v3/your-infura-project',
});

// Example: Withdraw tokens
await sdk.withdraw({
  pin: '1234',
  wallet: {
    publicKey: '0x...',
    encryptedPrivateKey: '...'
  },
  contractAddress: '0xStakingContract',
  amount: 25,
  decimals: 18,
  recipient: '0xYourWalletAddress',
});
```

## Return Value

Returns a `Promise<string | null>`:

- **string**: Transaction hash if the withdrawal was successful.
- **null**: If there was an error or the transaction failed to send.
